This is just my set of notes as I follow along with Bartosz Milewski's Category Theory for Programmers book https://unglueit-files.s3.amazonaws.com/ebf/e90890f0a6ea420c9825657d6f3a851d.pdf

I will also try and complete the exercises along side the chapter summaries which I produce.

Additionally, I will be trying out a reading method that I came across in a YouTube video which says to take the following steps when consuming content
- Skim the headers
- Skim the first and last lines of each page
- Skim the first and last lines of each paragraph
- Then read through the content

There is also this reading group which follows along with the book which I will try to use along side my consumption of it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SmXB2K_5lcA&list=PLVFrD1dmDdvcjCQDPhExqP56jqxp0Ssn_
